# 221-final-template
Contains HTML and CSS files for JNL 221's final project.  
  
## Due 11/25: Follow the below directions to start your final project template. Remember to have final.html open in a browser to see your changes taking place. Use the reference sheet and Google as a resource.  
1. In the `head` of final.html, under the appropriate comment, add a `link` tag to connect your HTML file to the included CSS file, final.css.  
2. In final.css, add styles for a `p` element: a `font-family` of 'Times New Roman' (with a default of serif), and a `font-size` of 20px. Look at the `style` section of the reference sheet to figure out how to add the `font-family` properly.  
3. In final.html, give the first `section` element a class of 'header'.  
4. In the same `section` element, fill in the byline with the `h4` element with your name.  
5. In the second `section` element in final.html, add an `img` tag below the `h3`. Add the png within this folder as the `src` attribute, as well as an appropriate `alt` text. Add a `height` of 150px and a `width` of 200px.  
6. In the fourth `section` element, under the appropriate comment, add one of your final project Datawrapper charts using an `iframe`.  
7. In final.css, change the `background-color` of .header to be something other than black and choose a compatible, visible `color` for the text. Use this color palette generator: https://coolors.co/. (Click on 'Start the generator!' and use the space bar to scroll through different color palettes.)  
8. In final.css, add styles for an `img` element: a `float` of right, a `margin-right` of 5% and a `margin-left` of 5%. Go to your browser to see this change, and drag your browser to different sizes to see what this does.  
9. In final.html, add appropriate text in your hed and dek for your final project story. Make sure it reflects what is newsworthy about your story, similar to a dataviz finding.  
10. Change or add one thing to your CSS that you'd like your project to have. It cannot be just a color or border; it must be something we have not done together in class. Add a comment in your code (hightlight the text then hit command+? to comment something out) to explain what you added.  
   
TODO in-class: In the head of final.html, under the appropriate comment, add the Google font 'Poppins' to your project. (We haven't learned how to do this so don't worry about it for homework. We will go over in class, after the break.)   

To submit: Upload `final.html`, `final.css`, and `syr.png` to your own repository. Like you did for `basic.html`, insert the appropriate link for your final.html webpage into our 'github accounts' Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bjyo7MdN8ORCXo55WihXbK81KfBFgZAs3oOlbiXH8is/edit.
